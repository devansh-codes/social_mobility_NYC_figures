# social_mobility_NYC_figures
In this project, 10 variables were employed to analyze the upward mobility of a neighborhood in NYC. 

The 10 county-level variables the group chose to analyze are the following:  
1.	Life expectancy
2.	Median income
3.	Count of people below poverty level in the past 12 months
4.	Unemployment rate
5.	Combined crime criminal activities count
6.	Count of educational attainment of regular high school diploma 
7.	Count of housing units
8.	Count of civilians in household with USD up to $25000
9.	Count of people per area
10.	Count of native people born outside the US

After the data files were downloaded and merged, the count predictors were converted to rates. Then, linear regression was run on six predictors. Four of the predictors- life expectancy, combined crime criminal activities count, count of people per area, and count of people below poverty level in the past 12 months- showed NA values when linear regression was done.
